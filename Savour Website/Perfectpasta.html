        <p>Pasta is a loved dish worldwide, but achieving that perfect al dente texture and rich flavour takes a bit of know-how. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned cook, these five tips will elevate your pasta-making skills.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use Plenty of Salted Water
                <p>Salt your water generously to flavour the pasta from within. A good rule of thumb is about 1 tablespoon of salt per litre of water. The water should taste like the sea!</p>
            </li>
            <li>Don't Add Oil to the Water
                <p>Adding oil to the water will prevent the sauce from sticking to the pasta. Instead, stir the pasta occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Cook Until Just Al Dante
                <p>Check your pasta a minute or two before the package instructions say it's done. Pasta will continue to cook slightly after draining, especially if you toss it with a hot sauce.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Save Some Pasta Water
                <p>Before draining your pasta, reserve about a cup of the starchy cooking water. Adding this to your sauce can help it cling to the pasta and create a silky, cohesive dish.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Toss Pasta with the Sauce Immediately
                <p>Don't let your pasta sit around after draining. Toss it with your sauce immediately to ensure that the pasta absorbs the flavours and the sauce clings to the noodles.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>With these simple yet effective tips, you’ll be serving up pasta dishes that taste like they’re straight from an Italian kitchen. Buon appetito!</p>
